This example demonstrates a common issue in F# related to the scope of mutable variables when used within functions.  The `swap` function attempts to modify the values of `x` and `y`, but these changes are only local to the function. The global variables `x` and `y` remain unchanged.  The solution shows how to achieve the desired effect using tuples or by passing the variables by reference (though this is less idiomatic F#).
